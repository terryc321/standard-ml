The first implementation of queue uses a linked list.

Implements a queue using a list

An empty queue is the empty list ```[]```

Enqueue appends entire queue onto a single element list.   This is costly if the queue is long , effectively traverse entire queue then cons the tail

Queue2 implementation declares a datatype with two constructors

empty

enq (enqueue) 

 Queue2 defines a new datatype and two constructors empty and enq .

queue is empty if queue is the empty constructor
#+begin_src sml :exports code 

  hd of one element queue is x
  hd enq (empty ,x ) = x

  otherwise queue has more elements find hd in first of enq
      enq(empty,1)
      enq(enq(empty,1),2)
      enq(enq(enq(empty,1),2),3)
      enq(enq(enq(enq(empty,1),2),3),4)
      enq(enq(enq(enq(enq(empty,1),2),3),4),5)
      enq(enq(enq(enq(enq(enq(empty,1),2),3),4),5),6)

#+end_src

      
  when we add someone to end of queue (called enqueue) we simply make a constructor
  of old queue and new person we added

       enq( old-queue , new-person )

  if we want to find the front of the queue (Queue2.hd) we need to recursively
  go into the first element of enq constructor
        enq ( A , B) will repeatedly go into A
        until we pattern match on enq ( empty , X ) return X 

  dequeue take someone from the front of the list we need to again repeatedly go into
  first element
         enq (A , B) will repeatedly go into A until
        match on enq ( empty , X) which will return empty  ie taken X from front of queue
         as it recursively comes back down the stack , rebuilds the queue
          with first person taken from queue

      if queue is empty when we deque , raise an exception since no queue to dequeue


#+begin_src sml :tangle "code/queue.sml"  :exports both :noweb yes :results value code :output replace :session *sml*
    structure Queue2 =

      | deq (enq(q,x ))     = enq(deq q, x )
      | deq empty           = raise E ;
    end;

Regarding Queue2

Our datatype declaration flouts the convention that constructor names start
with a capital letter (Section 4.4). Within the confines of a small structure this is
a minor matter, but to export such a constructor is questionable.


Queue3 uses two lists A B

idea behind this is that cons-ing is a cheap operation

represent tail of queue as a something that can be quickly cons-ed onto

to put x onto end of queue is a single cons operation :: 

# #+begin_src sml :exports code 
#  Queue ( _ , tails ) -> Queue ( _ , x :: tails ) 
# #+end_src

an empty queue is A B both empty

norm when A empty , swaps A with reverse B , B becomes empty

norm when heads A is not empty just returns input , acts like identity function

when want to enqueue x  -> norm the queue with x cons'd onto tails

front of queue is hd of heads A

deque take someone off the front of the queue , just norm Queue heads tails

# #+begin_src sml :exports code 
#  Queue ( x :: heads , tails ) -> norm $ Queue ( heads , tails )
# #+end_src

Queue3 is due to (Burton, 1982)

#+begin_src sml :tangle "code/queue.sml"  :exports both :noweb yes :results output :output replace :session *sml*

  structure Queue3 =
  struct
  datatype 'a t = Queue of ('a list * 'a list);
  exception E ;
  val empty = Queue([],[]);
  fun norm (Queue([],tails)) = Queue(rev tails, [])
    | norm q = q;
  fun enq(Queue(heads,tails), x ) = norm(Queue(heads, x ::tails));
  fun null (Queue([],[])) = true
    | null _ = false;
  fun hd (Queue(x ::_,_)) = x
    | hd (Queue([],_)) = raise E ;
  fun deq(Queue(x ::heads,tails)) = norm(Queue(heads,tails))
    | deq(Queue([],_)) = raise E ;

7.4 The intended signature for queues

Although the structures Queue1, Queue2 and Queue3 differ, they each
implement queues. Moreover they share a common interface, defined by signature QUEUE:

#+begin_src sml :tangle "code/queue.sml"  :exports both :noweb yes :results code :output replace :session *sml*
signature QUEUE =
sig
type 'a t  (*type of queues*)
exception E (*for errors in hd, deq*)
val empty: 'a t  (*the empty queue*)
val enq : 'a t * 'a -> 'a t  (*add to end*)
val null : 'a t -> bool  (*test for empty queue*)
val hd : 'a t -> 'a  (*return front element*)
val deq : 'a t -> 'a t  (*remove from front*)
end;
  
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src sml
val it = "stdIn" : string
#+end_src

Each entry in a signature is called a specification. The comments after each
specification are optional, but make the signature more informative. A structure
is an instance of this signature provided it declares, at least,

• a polymorphic type α t (which need not admit equality)

• an exception E

• a value empty of type α t

• a value enq of type α t × α → α t

• a value null of type α t → bool

• a value hd of type α t → α

• a value deq of type α t → α t
  

    7.5 Signature constraints

    Transparent signature constraints. The constraints we have used until now, in-
    dicated by a colon (:), are transparent. To see what this implies, let us constrain
    our existing queue structures using signature QUEUE:

#+begin_src sml :tangle "code/queue.sml"  :exports both :noweb yes :results code :output replace :session *sml*

  structure S1: QUEUE = Queue1;
  structure S2: QUEUE = Queue2;
  structure S3: QUEUE = Queue3;

  S1.deq ["We","band","of","brothers"];

  val Queue3.Queue(heads,tails) = S3.enq(S3.enq(S3.empty,"Saint"), "Crispin");
    
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src sml
structure S2 : QUEUE
#+end_src


  These declarations make S 1, S 2 and S 3 denote the same structures as Queue1,
  Queue2 and Queue3, respectively. However, the new structures are constrained
  to have the signature QUEUE. The types α Queue2.t and α S 2.t are identical,
  yet Queue2.empty is a constructor while S 2.empty may only be used as a
  value. The structures Queue3 and S 3 are identical, yet Queue3.norm is a
  function while S 3.norm means nothing.
  A transparent signature constraint may hide components, but they are still
  present. This cannot be called abstraction. Structure S 1 does not hide its repre-
  sentation at all; type α S 1.t is identical to α list.


#+begin_src 
  > ["band", "of", "brothers"] : string S1.t
#+end_src
  
  Structures S 2 and S 3 may seem more abstract, because they declare the type
  α t and hide its constructors. Without the constructors, pattern-matching is not
  available to take apart values of the type and disclose the representation. How-
  ever, the constructor Queue3.Queue may be used in a pattern to take apart a
  value of type α S 3.t:
  
#+begin_src 
  > val heads = ["Saint"] : string list
  > val tails = ["Crispin"] : string list
#+end_src
  
  The concrete structure, Queue3, provides a loophole into its abstract view, S 3.
  Data abstraction is compromised in another way. For each of our queue struc-
  tures, type α t admits equality testing. The equality test compares internal rep-
  resentations, not queues. Under Representation 3, the values ([1, 2], []) and
  ([1], [2]) denote the same queue, but the equality test says they are different.

  
  Opaque signature constraints. Using the symbol ```:>``` instead of a colon makes
the constraint opaque. The constraint hides all information about the new struc-
ture except its signature. Let us create some truly abstract queue structures by
constraining the concrete ones:

The components of the constrained structure are divorced from their counter-
parts in the original structure. Structure AbsQueue1 represents queues by lists,
but we cannot see this:

#+begin_src sml :tangle "code/queue.sml"  :exports both :noweb yes :results code :output replace :session *sml*

  (* an opaque :> signature constraint *)

  structure AbsQueue1 :> QUEUE = Queue1;
  structure AbsQueue2 :> QUEUE = Queue2;
  structure AbsQueue3 :> QUEUE = Queue3;

#+end_src

# alert ! 
# empty source blocks cause wrong argument stringp , nil errors with no telling why

#+begin_src sml :tangle "code/queue.sml"  :exports both :noweb yes :results code :output replace :session *sml*
(* AbsQueue1.deq ["We","band","of","brothers"];  *)
  "Error";
#+end_src

#+begin_src sml :tangle "code/queue.sml"  :exports both :noweb yes :results code :output replace :session *sml*
  (* AbsQueue3.empty = AbsQueue3.empty; *)
  "Error";
#+end_src


Limitations. An opaque signature constraint is perfect for declaring an abstract
type of queues. The abstract structure can be made from an existing concrete
structure, as in the AbsQueue declarations above, or we can simply constrain
the original structure declaration:

# structure Queue :> QUEUE = struct . . . end;

But the two kinds of signature constraints give us an all-or-nothing choice,
which is awkward for complex abstract types. Signature DICTIONARY spec-
ifies two types: key is the type of search keys; α t is the type of dictionaries
(see Section 4.14). Type α t should be abstract, but key should be something
concrete, like string. Otherwise, we should have no way to refer to keys; we
should be unable to call lookup and update! The next section describes a more
flexible approach to declaring abstract types.

# # https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~fischer/cs538.s06/lectures/Lecture25.pdf
# # code available from ~cs538-1/public/sml/struct.sml


#+begin_src sml :tangle "code/map.sml"  :exports code :noweb yes :results code :output replace :session *sml*

  structure Mapping =
  struct
  exception NotFound;
  val create = [];
  fun lookup(key,[]) =
      raise NotFound
    | lookup(key,
     	   (key1,value1)::rest) =
      if key = key1
      then value1
      else lookup(key,rest);

  fun insert(key,value,[]) =
      [(key,value)]
    | insert(key,value,
    	   (key1,value1)::rest) =
      if key = key1
      then (key,value)::rest
      else (key1,value1)::
    	 insert(key,value,rest);
  end;

  Mapping.insert(538,"languages",[]);

  open Mapping;


#+end_src

We can see the signature of Mapping created by standard ml

#+begin_src sml 
structure Mapping : sig
  exception NotFound
  val create : 'a list
  val lookup : ''a * (''a * 'b) list -> 'b
  val insert : ''a * 'b * (''a * 'b) list -> (''a * 'b) list
end
#+end_src

You can define a signature as

#+begin_src sml 
signature name = sig
 type definitions for values,
 functions and exceptions
end
#+end_src

For example,

#+begin_src sml :tangle "code/map.sml"  :exports both :noweb yes :results code :output replace :session *sml*
signature Str2IntMapping =
sig
 exception NotFound;
 val lookup: string * (string*int) list -> int;
end;
#+end_src

Signatures can be used to

• Restrict the type of a value or function in a structure.

• Hide selected definitions that appear in a structure

For example

#+begin_src sml :tangle "code/map.sml"  :exports both :noweb yes :results code :output replace :session *sml*
  structure Str2IntMap : Str2IntMapping = Mapping;
  open Str2IntMap;
#+end_src
  
  defines a new structure, Str2IntMap,   created by restricting Mapping to the
  Str2IntMapping signature. When  we do this we get
  
  Only lookup and NotFound are created, and lookup is limited to keys that are strings.

# #+begin_src sml :tangle "code/map.sml"  :exports both :noweb yes :results code :output replace :session *sml*
# #+end_src


Extending ML’s Polymorphism
In languages like C++ and Java we
must use types like void* or Object
to simulate the polymorphism that
ML provides. In ML whenever possible
a general type (a polytype) is used
rather than a fixed type. Thus in
fun len([]) = 0
 | len(a::b) = 1 + len(b);
we get a type of
 'a list -> int
because this is the most general type
possible that is consistent with len’s
definition.
Is this form of polymorphism general
enough to capture the general idea of
making program definitions as typeindependent as possible?



It isn’t, and to see why consider the
following ML definition of a merge
sort. A merge sort operates by first
splitting a list into two equal length
sublists. The following function does
this:

#+begin_src sml :tangle "code/map.sml"  :exports both :noweb yes :results code :output replace :session *sml*

fun split [] = ([],[])
 | split [a] = ([a],[])
 | split (a::b::rest) =
 let val (left,right) =
 split(rest) in
 (a::left, b::right)
 end;

#+end_src

After the input list is split into two
halves, each half is recursively sorted,
then the sorted halves are merged
together into a single list.
The following ML function merges
two sorted lists into one:


#+begin_src sml :tangle "code/map.sml"  :exports both :noweb yes :results code :output replace :session *sml*

  fun merge([],[]) = []
     | merge([],hd::tl) = hd::tl
     | merge(hd::tl,[]) = hd::tl
     | merge(hd::tl,h::t) =
     if hd <= h
     then hd::merge(tl,h::t)
     else h::merge(hd::tl,t);

#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_src sml
val it = "stdIn" : string
#+end_src

With these two subroutines, a
definition of a sort is easy:

#+begin_src sml :tangle "code/map.sml"  :exports both :noweb yes :results code :output replace :session *sml*

  fun sort [] = []
    | sort([a]) = [a]
    | sort(a::b::rest) =
      let val (left,right) =
  	    split(a::b::rest) in
  	merge(sort(left),
  	      sort(right))
      end;

#+end_src

This definition looks very general—it
should work for a list of any type.
Unfortunately, when ML types the
functions we get a surprise:

#+begin_src sml 

val split = fn : 'a list ->
 'a list * 'a list
val merge = fn : int list *
 int list -> int list
val sort = fn :
 int list -> int list

#+end_src

split is polymorphic, but merge and
sort are limited to integer lists!
Where did this restriction come from?

The problem is that we did a
comparison in merge using the <=
operator, and ML typed this as an
integer comparison.
We can make our definition of sort
more general by adding a comparison
function, le(a,b) as a parameter to
merge and sort. If we curry this
parameter we may be able to hide it
from end users. Our updated
definitions are:

#+begin_src sml :tangle "code/map.sml"  :exports both :noweb yes :results code :output replace :session *sml*

fun merge(le,[],[]) = []
 | merge(le,[],hd::tl) = hd::tl
 | merge(le,hd::tl,[]) = hd::tl
 | merge(le,hd::tl,h::t) =
 if le(hd,h)
 then hd::merge(le,tl,h::t)
 else h::merge(le,hd::tl,t)

fun sort le [] = []
 | sort le [a] = [a]
 | sort le (a::b::rest) =
 let val (left,right) =
 split(a::b::rest) in
 merge(le, sort le left,
sort le right)
 end;

#+end_src


Now the types of merge and sort are:

#+begin_src sml

     val merge = fn :
     ('a * 'a -> bool) *
     'a list * 'a list -> 'a list
    val sort = fn : ('a * 'a -> bool)
     -> 'a list -> 'a list
#+end_src

 We can now “customize” sort by
  choosing a particular definition for
  the le parameter:
  
  		
#+begin_src sml :tangle "code/map.sml"  :exports both :noweb yes :results output :output replace :session *sml*
  fun le(a,b) = a <= b;
#+end_src
