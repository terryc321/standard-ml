ml-burg \- a tree parser generator for Standard ML
.SH "SYNOPSIS"

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
The \fBml\-burg\fP program generates a \fBStandard ML\fP program to perform
bottom\-up rewriting of an input tree. Cost information associated
with each rewrite rule is used to derive the minimum rewrite cost
for the entire tree. A successful reduction corresponds to rewriting
the input tree to a special non\-terminal symbol called the
\fIstart non\-terminal\fP. Upon successful reduction, facilities are
provided to walk the tree emitting semantic actions corresponding to
the rules that matched.
